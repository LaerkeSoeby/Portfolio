            <p>I am a <b><i>creative</i></b> and <b><i>curious</i></b> personality. And deeply fascinated by human <b><i>psychology</i></b>. Combined with my analyzing nature and natrual talent for <b><i>fine motor skills</i></b>, I'll consider myself a
                designer by heart. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Therefor my goal in design is creating design that not only <b><i>looks good</i></b>, but is easy to use and has a lot of <b><i>thought 
            behind it</i></b>. The greatest thing about design is seeing your ideas becoming reality. </p>

            <h1>Schedule</h1>
            <p>It's important to me to have a detailed plan, and always be strategic when working on a project. </p>

            <h1>Everything has a meaning</h1>
            <p>I like being analytic and I always want to know why and how. I think it comes in handy when i comes to understanding the different target groups.</p>

            <h1>Being objective</h1>
            <p>Seeing multiple sides of the same case is natural to me. And i think it's important to see things from different perspectives to create balance. </p>

            <h1>Strive to be perfect</h1>
            <p>Being a perfectionist comes with challenges, but it also keeps me passionate.</p>
